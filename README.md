# African Penguin Fishery Closures MS 
The code here is to reproduce the analysis and figures presented in the manuscript:
Glencross et al (in prep) Commercial fisheries have a cascading effect on prey and predator behaviour 

## The scripts folder contains:

1. MS_models
This script consists of the GLMMs and LMMs presented in the main manuscript as well as the corresponding model output plots.
2. MS_ICEpanel_models
This script consists of the final GLMMs and LMMs using the Island Closure Experiment Expert Panel random effect structures.
3. MS_relationship_models
This script contains the code to run the LMMs used to look at the effect of fishing on the relationship between the metrics. These models used the same random effect structure as used in the main manuscript.

## Completed scripts
1. MS_models
2. MS_ICEpanel_models
3. MS_relationship_models


## Still to be completed
1. Calibrated school detection (merge all the settings into one file)
2. Calibrated_fish_pipeline
3. GPS pipeline
4. TDR pipeline
5. figures/maps
